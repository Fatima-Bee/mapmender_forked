Mapmender - See the World as it Is — Not as it Was.

Navigating rural roads, less-traveled routes, and rapidly changing environments can be challenging, especially when available map data is out of date. It is difficult for navigation apps to stay current with so many changing real-world conditions. Our app addresses this by providing a community-driven mapping platform that helps users report, discover, and navigate road conditions accurately, while quickly updating map data for others.

Our goal is to develop a mobile-first full-stack application using JavaScript.  We aim to create a front-end interface that can be easily used on the go to read and write to an ArcGIS Online (AGOL) database. 

Users can report the current status of roads—open, temporarily closed, permanently closed, private or restricted, or nonexistent. Reports can include detailed impassability reasons, such as washed-out sections, overgrown paths, construction, gated entries, or obstructive debris, as well as roads that never existed or no longer exist. This structured system ensures that others understand not just whether a road is closed, but why, enabling safer and better-informed travel.

The app also captures hazards along routes, including potholes, narrow passages, low or high clearance points, sharp turns, wildlife crossings, icy or snowy areas, blind hills, steep grades, and encounters with aggressive animals. Hazards remain relevant whether a road is open or closed, providing awareness for all users navigating the route.

A community-driven approach is central to the platform. Local drivers, hikers, cyclists, overlanders, and adventurers contribute updates, validate reports, and share firsthand knowledge of routes often missing from standard maps. Contributions include GPS-tagged locations, photos, and timestamps, creating a reliable, real-time dataset. To encourage participation, the app offers a points and recognition system, awarding badges for verified contributions, first reports, or high-quality updates. Contributors can track their impact, see how their reports help others, and gain reputation within the community.

Designed for practical use, the app includes offline functionality, allowing access to maps and updates without connectivity. Routing considers open roads while still showing hazards on closed routes for informational purposes.

By combining verified data, community contributions, and flexible reporting, the app helps users navigate confidently, stay aware of hazards, and connect with others exploring less-mapped roads.
